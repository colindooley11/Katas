As Title

First Kata is 99 Bottles   

A Kata pulled from the book 99 Bottles of OOP by Sandi Metz (and adapted from some simple Ruby tests)

It is basic, but its main purpose is to identify how simplistic an implementation can be designed and it is a talking point for getting to "Shameless Green" which is just enough (no more, no less) to meet a set of requirements.
